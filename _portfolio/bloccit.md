## Summary
Bloccit is an information sharing application.  It allows users to create their own profile from which they can create topics, posts, and comments.  Users can also vote on and favorite posts that they like, or dislike.

## Explanation

Bloccit was the first project I worked on to develop a website using Ruby on Rails.  Working on this project, with my mentor Mark, increased my ability to develop websites and to use Ruby on Rails.  Bloccit also provided me with experience using test driven development and creating CRUD functionality and taught me a lot.

## Problem

Unlike some other projects there were no parts of this project that stood out as particularly difficult.  The difficult part of Bloccit was the fact that it was the first Ruby on Rails project, which involved a learning curve starting with using a new text editor.  My past projects, which had been written in JavaScript, I used Atom as my text editor; however, for this project it was recommended I use cloud9.  I had some difficulties getting cloud9 to work correctly, but I solved and got cloud9 to run smoothly.

I learned to generate and use models and controllers and organize my data into model-view-controller.  I learned test driven development, how to use Heroku to deploy a website, and how to use SendGrid to send emails from a website.  No indiviudal educational goal caused me difficulties, just learning so much in one project was difficult and I felt accomplished when I completed Bloccit.  

## Solution

The solution was talking with Mark and reviewing the information Bloc provided to help me learn the material until it clicked and I had a better understanding of what I was doing.  

## Results

The result was I got practice learning programming, a skill that will help me professionally.  Mark was very helpful, but he also was very busy and not always available.  As a result, I frequently used Bloc documents and online documents to solve various bugs that came up during the development of Bloccit.  I hope to continue the use of these techniques to learn more on my own time.

## Conclusion

Bloccit, being completed as a bloc project, was very beneficial. It not only provided me an opportunity to increase my skills as a web developer, it also allowed me to learn Ruby on Rails, test driven development and a variety of new skills.  Many websites provide users the ability to log in and create, modify, update, and delete data.  This skillset that I learned from Bloccit will be valuable to future web development projects.  To truly see the beauty of Bloccit it would have to be used by the public and unfortunately as a Bloc project I do not think that will ever happen.  It makes me look forward to the day when I develop a website for public consumption and get to watch my users utilize the CRUD functionality I created and read some of their posts.

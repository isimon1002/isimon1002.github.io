For my second specialization I chose the Alexa Project.  I chose this specialization for two reasons; my mentor Mark is experienced in creating Alexa Skills and it will allow me to leave Bloc with an additional skillset.  Hopefully my ability to create Alexa Skills will be valuable in my search for employment and throughout my career.   

My first Alexa Skill, which is called MMA Trivia, and can be invoked by saying, “Alexa, open MMA trivia.” When I started working on it I was confused even though I was looking at the step by step instructions that Amazon provides for how to create a trivia skill.  Specifically, when you are creating an Alexa Skill there are two different things that work together, your skill information in Amazon’s Alexa Skill Developer Portal and Amazon Web Service’s Lambda service.  Basically, in Amazon’s Alexa Skill Developer Portal you input the information about your skill such as its name, and what category of skill it is such as educational.  The only technical part of Amazon’s Alexa Skill Developer Portal is the interaction model where you organize the intents that run your skill and the slots that they use.  The intents are like functions and the slots are similar to variables.  For example, in my MMA Trivia skill I created a AnswerIntent that has a slot that takes and stores the user’s answer to the trivia question and then does different things depending on whether the user is correct.   The actual code for the Skills are input into Amazon Web Service’s Lambda service which runs the skill.  To connect the code there is an Amazon Resource Name that is unique for each Skill and allows the information in the Amazon’s Alexa Skill Developer Portal and Amazon Web Service’s Lambda service to look at the same skill, so that the skill can run.  Once I figured out how they worked together I could start creating Alexa Skills.  Currently I have four skills that are live and a fifth skill that is undergoing Amazon’s Skill Certification process.   

Amazon has some tutor skills that they provide much of the code and allow the developer to change segments of code to learn how to create Alexa Skills.  I used this code to create two skills, MMA Trivia and Animal Facts.  Amazon’s original code is reindeer trivia, which quizzes the user about reindeer.  Personally, I am a fan of MMA and train jujitsu, so I wanted to create a trivia game that was on a topic I enjoy, so I picked MMA.  I looked up some historical champions, and quizzed people on them.  I figured that history does not change, unlike current events and world records, so they were safe for use in my trivia game.

The second Amazon tutor skill I created was animal facts.  I have a Bachelor’s degree in Zoology, so I have studied animals in the past.  I even did some field work in Israel where we caught a viper on the top of a mountain.   That was a fun day.  I searched for random animal facts to replace Amazon’s default space facts.  It was interesting as various websites contradicted each other, but in the end, I found the World Wildlife Fund and National Geographic to be trustworthy sources for my facts.  

I then moved on to create my own Alexa Skills.  The first one I created is called Twisted Movie Quotes.  There are a lot of famous movie quotes that include someone’s name.  I thought it would be funny to replace the name in the quote with the user’s first name, so I created an Alexa Skill to do that.  The skill asks the user for his or her name and then used the name in one fifty movie quotes.  For example, instead of, “Frankly Scarlett, I don’t give a damn” the app might say, “Frankly Isaac, I don’t give a damn.”

My fourth and most recently started live skill is called Random Recipes.  It got certified before Twisted Movie Quotes.  It provides the user with a list of randomly chosen recipes to choose from.  The user then says the name of the food that they want the recipe for and Alexa provides them with the recipe.  I decided to create this skill, because I enjoy a good meal, so I figured I would share some recipes that hopefully will lead to other people enjoying a good meal.

I am a sports fan and I enjoy baseball, so I decided to create a skill in honor of Hank Aaron, the steroid free home run king and the all-time RBI leader for major league baseball.  The app asks the user to pick a year of Hank Aaron's career and tells the user how many RBIs he hit that year and if he lead major league baseball in RBIs that year.  This skill is currently in its certification faze.  After a developer completes a skill he or she submits it to Amazon for certification.  If it gets certified it gets sent to the skill store and becomes available for public consumption.  If it fails certification Amazon tells the developer, why it failed so the developer can try to fix the skill.  Hopefully my Hank Aaron Runs Batted In skill gets certified to allow people to play it.  

 I have also played with skills that I do not intend on publishing to teach myself more tricks for creating Alexa skills, so my Alexa Skills developer page contains more skills than will ever see the light of day.

I have enjoyed creating these skills and I plan on creating more.  It is fun playing a skill you created and thinking I built that.

title: Completed BlocChat
---
I just completed BlocChat.  BlocChat was the most difficult project for me so far in the Bloc curriculum.  Both sending data to the Firebase database, as well as receiving and displaying information from the Firebase database that I used in this project was difficult to get correct.  With help from my new mentor Mark I successfully complete the BlocChat.  

BlocChat was not only the most difficult project for me for technical reasons, but also for situational reasons.  My original mentor Aaron started his own coding bootcamp in North Carolina and left Bloc leaving me without a mentor.  Bloc has infrastructure in place for when a mentor leaves and allowed me to choose a new mentor which ended up being Mark.  Trying to learn Firebase, work on a new difficult project, and transition mentors was difficult.  I was also worried that Mark would be too busy with his preexisting students to help me, or not want to take a new student who was already in the middle of Bloc.  My worries were alleviated when I started working with Mark and he was very patient and helpful in helping get me unstuck.  For example, I did not realize that when you create an AngularJS controller, or service, the list of dependency injections and the list variables need to be in the same order and this caused an error when I tried to call functions from a service in a controller that prevented me from testing my functions let alone making progress.  Mark even scheduled an extra meeting on the weekend to help me solve the difficulties I was having with BlocChat.    

Upon the completion of BlocChat I have started thinking about other websites I would like to develop for my own personal gratification.  For example, my brother is one of the best jugglers on the planet holding numerous world records.  He even has his own page on the juggle wiki website seen below.  I would enjoy developing a website that displays his juggling skills where people could view pictures and videos of him juggling such as the gif below that displays a few seconds of his world record passing 11 balls with his juggling partner.

I am also personally interested in Brazilian Jujitsu and I train it as a hobby.  Some of my teammates are highly skilled individuals and I would like to create a website that displays the accomplishments of my coach and teammates by showing videos of their matches and talking about the Jujitsu portion of their lives such as when and why they started training.  
I value the knowledge that I could create websites about topics and people I appreciate.  I also appreciate that once I start making websites I will learn a lot, not only about the technical aspects of web development, but about the people, places, and topics for which I develop websites.

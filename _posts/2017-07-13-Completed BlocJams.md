title: Completed BlocJams
---
I just completed BlocJams.  It was the first website I ever created without the use of a software to help.  Bloc did provide some framework for the website and my mentor Aaron helped me with some issues, but overall, I created a website.  BlocJams even contains interactive parts where the user can click on play bars and seek bars to play music and move throughout a song.  It is not just a website that displays static information where the only thing the user does is scroll.

Working on BlocJams was the first opportunity in Bloc to write code.  I previously learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Code School's coursework, but there is a significant difference between doing Code School challenges and writing your own code.  I also find it very enjoyable when I write new code while my live server displaying my website runs and can receive the instant gratification of watching my code work.  Even when all my code was doing was changing the background of BlocJams' home page from white to the requested background image, it was exciting to see my programing work.

While working on BlocJams, Bloc also introduced me to Codewars.  Codewars is a website that contains coding challenges for users to perform to improve their programming skills.  They have challenges for a variety of programming languages, but the ones I worked on were all in JavaScript.  Working on these challenges increased my skill set.  For example, one function takes 10 integers between 0 and 9 in an array and returns those integers in the format of a phone number.  In working on this function, I learned about JavaScript's built-in replace function.  Learning about various built-in JavaScript functions in this manner was helpful for my overall programming ability, because I never know when a situation will arise that calls for the use of a built-in function.  The Codewars challenges also helped me improve my usage of if-else statements and for loops.  In many functions, I nested an if-else statement in a for loop, and even used nested for loops.  I believe my ability to integrate if-else statements and for loops will be very helpful in writing code throughout my career as a web developer.  

Learning new things has always been something I enjoyed.  When I was doing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) work, frequently my boss would ask me to figure something out, or learn how to use a new software and I always enjoyed that process.  I became skilled enough in GIS to learn new software quickly.  For example, I learned a new software to perform spatial analyses on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, two diseases we were studying at the time, in an hour.  It took me years to develop the ability to learn GIS software quickly, but my goal is to keep on increasing my programming skills until I can learn new programming languages as quickly as I am able to learn new GIS software.

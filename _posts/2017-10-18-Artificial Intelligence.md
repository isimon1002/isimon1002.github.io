title: Artificial intelligence
---
The first time your creation beats you at something is a unique moment.  For me it happened with a pong game I created.  I created a Pong game for a Bloc assignment.  Feel free to play it here [Pong](http://aws-website-pong-czg7o.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).  I had not played pong in a while, so my pong skills were rusty and the first time I played pong against the artificial intelligence I created it destroyed me.  I was beaten by my own creation.  That experience of not only creating and artificial intelligence, but also losing to it increased my interest in artificial intelligence, how they work and how to create smarter ones.  

I know an artificial intelligence that can play pong is only a start, so the next project I picked with Mark is with Amazon's Alexa.  Alexa is a fun artificial intelligence in that you can talk to it and it responds somewhat intelligently.  My friend has one and when we hang out we sometimes play with it.  We have taken inspiration from South Park and put things that shall not be named here on the list.  It is also interesting to see the limitations of Alexa.  For example, if you ask her a question that is too specific, like how many times has Javy Baez struck out so far during the playoffs, she will not know the answer.   She works better if you ask her more generic questions such as who is Javy Baez.  There is a lot she knows, but there is also a lot she has yet to learn.

Bloc started my personal education on how to create new skills by creating an Alexa trivia skill.  I created an Alexa trivia game that quizzes the user on mixed martial arts trivia.  It asks the user questions about events that occurred either in the UFC, Pride, or Bellator and provides multiple choices.  A sample question is:
Who was the first Bellator Mixed Martial Arts champion?  
1. Hector Lombard
2. Eddie Alvarez
3. Joe Soto
4. Eddie Alvarez

The answer is...not going to be posted here.  You will have to ask me, google, or hopefully Alexa to find out if Amazon certifies it.  Playing with an artificial intelligence like Alexa and making it smarter by increasing its functionality it a fun process.  I am interested to see what else about Alexa and artificial intelligence I will learn from the Alexa projects I work on now and throughout my career.

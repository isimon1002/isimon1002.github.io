title: Web Design
---
I have been thinking about web design more recently for a couple reasons.  The first website I ever developed was a website about the Historical Missouri River I developed using of ArcGIS Viewer for Flex when I worked as a GIS Analyst.  Determining the best way to design the website within the limitations ArcGIS Viewer for Flex to provide the optimum user experience was an enjoyable collaboration between myself, my boss, and a historian.  It was very disappointing when, after I left that job, people who did not work on the project chose to move the website to a new server and when they put the website back together they ignored the design.  Now a website that myself and others spent hours designing looks awful and I am reluctant to share its URL with perspective employers as I do not want them to think I lack all web design skills.  

A second reason I have thought about web design is my Story Time project.  Amy and myself have been busy and not been putting in the time to improve its design lately, but the lessons I have learned from Amy in developing a user-friendly user experience stick in my head such as the importance of minimizing clicks.  This has led me to read some blog posts about web design and the importance of not hiding tools from the user to create a clean screen.  Make it easy for the user to do everything you want the user to be able to easily do.  Sounds simple, but sometimes websites and software hide important tools.  

It makes me hopeful that when I find a job, it will be one that allows me to work closely with designers, so I can improve my abilities as a web designer and a web developer.

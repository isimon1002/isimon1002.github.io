I am a web developer, Alexa Skill developer, and GIS analyst.  I enjoy watching a website change before my eyes as I develop it.  It is a special experience developing and then playing with Alexa Skills I created.  It is fun solving GIS puzzles and discovering new spatial patterns

My hobbies include traing Brazilian Jujitsu and studying politics.
